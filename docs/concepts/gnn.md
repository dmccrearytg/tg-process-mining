# Use of GNNs to Predict Future Events

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) can be used to predict future events in a graph where the vertices represent events, and the edges (e.g., `NEXT_EVENT` and `PREV_EVENT`) contain information such as duration. Here's how this can be done:

### 1\. **Graph Representation:**

-   **Vertices**: Each vertex in the graph represents an event.
-   **Edges**: The edges represent the relationship between events, such as which event follows another (`NEXT_EVENT`) or precedes another (`PREV_EVENT`). These edges contain a `duration` attribute that indicates the time between the events.

### 2\. **Feature Representation:**

-   **Vertex Features**: Each event vertex can have features like event type, timestamp, associated data, etc.
-   **Edge Features**: The edges contain the duration, which is a crucial feature for predicting the timing of future events.

### 3\. **Graph Construction for GNN:**

-   The graph is constructed where the event vertices are connected via directed edges (`NEXT_EVENT`/`PREV_EVENT`) with the duration as a feature of the edge.
-   This graph is then fed into a GNN, where the model can learn the temporal and sequential dependencies between events.

### 4\. **GNN Model Architecture:**

-   **Input Layer**: The input layer processes the features of the event vertices and the edge features (durations).
-   **Graph Convolutional Layers**: These layers propagate information between connected vertices. For instance, a message-passing mechanism can aggregate information from neighboring events (previous or next) to update the representation of the current event vertex.
-   **Temporal Embedding**: The duration feature can be explicitly used to create temporal embeddings that allow the model to learn the time-based dependencies between events.
-   **Recurrent Layer (optional)**: In some cases, a recurrent layer (like an LSTM or GRU) can be used to model the sequential nature of events further.

### 5\. **Training the GNN:**

-   **Loss Function**: The loss function is typically designed to minimize the difference between predicted and actual future event times or to classify the type of future event correctly.
-   **Supervision**: The model can be supervised by using historical event sequences where the ground truth for future events is known.

### 6\. **Prediction Process:**

-   **Prediction**: For a given current graph of events, the trained GNN can predict the next event(s) by considering the learned relationships (from the graph structure and edge durations) and output a prediction for the next event's occurrence time or the type of event that will happen next.
-   **Inference**: During inference, you can use the GNN to predict not just the immediate next event but potentially a sequence of future events by iteratively updating the graph with predicted events and re-applying the model.

### 7\. **Handling Duration in Prediction:**

-   The duration between events is key to predicting future events. The GNN uses the duration in the edge features to inform predictions of the timing of future events.
-   By learning from the historical duration data, the model can predict how long until the next event occurs.

### 8\. **Example Use Case:**

-   Suppose you have a graph where each vertex represents a customer order event, and edges represent the sequence of orders, with the duration representing the time between orders.
-   The GNN can learn to predict when the next order will happen based on the past sequence of orders and durations between them.

### 9\. **Potential GNN Models:**

-   **Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN)**: To learn node embeddings considering the local structure.
-   **Graph Attention Networks (GAT)**: To learn which events (nodes) are more influential when predicting the next event.
-   **Temporal GNNs**: Specifically designed to handle temporal information and predict future events.

### 10\. **Implementation Tips:**

-   **Data Preparation**: Ensure that your graph data is prepared with the correct vertex and edge features, especially focusing on accurate duration data.
-   **Model Tuning**: Experiment with different GNN architectures and hyperparameters, such as the number of layers, embedding size, and learning rate, to optimize performance.
-   **Temporal Information**: Consider incorporating additional temporal features, such as time of day or day of the week, which could improve predictions.

By applying a GNN in this manner, you can effectively model and predict future events in a graph, leveraging the sequential and temporal relationships embedded in the graph's structure and edge features.
